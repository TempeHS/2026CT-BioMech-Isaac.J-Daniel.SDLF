the OLED screen is supposed to show general information about the device, such as it's battery, the updates on pairing mode and the powering on and off screen. It
 will also show the welcome screen.
When the command controller is powered on, the OLED screen will display a "powering on... welcome" message. After it is powered on, this message will dissapear.
