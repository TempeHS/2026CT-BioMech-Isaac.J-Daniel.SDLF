Brief Description: We are creating an accesible videogame controller for patients who have some sort of phyical condition, impairment or abnormaltiy which restricts the proper use of standard video game controllers. Some diseases which could make people reqiure such a controller could be: muscular dystrophy and marfan syndrome among many others. Our specific pantient is called Anna, who has progressive muscular dystrophy which has made it very hard for her to play video games using standard input methods. Her disease has advanced to the point of not being able to use a console controller, meaning she now needs another way of playing games. We are prototyping a design which heavily relies on touch sensors and a minimal amount of buttons, and customisable settings to ensure that she can adjust the controller to her needs. The wide touch sesors ensure that she doesnt need to press really small buttons and use much coordination to be able to play her game. This will enable her to play video games comfortable once more

Components list:

- 1 Arduino Board
- 2 touch sensor
- 12 Arduino Sensor Kit Buttons
- 1 high quality Microphone
- 1 Aruino OLED screen
- 1 web active computer
